# Happy Celebrations Hub!

The purpose of this website is to facilitate the celebration of special occasions that often seem less important to busy individuals. Many people either forget or don't know how to celebrate the special occasions of their loved ones such as parents, friends, or partners. Therefore, this website uses the Chat GPT API to generate personalized messages for your loved one's special day by simply filling out a form, and sends that message to their email address.

As a result, we help alleviate the burden on busy individuals' to-do lists through this website.
